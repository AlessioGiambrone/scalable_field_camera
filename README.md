Scalable large format field camera - 4x5 - 5x7 - 8x10

This is my attempt to create a scalable large format field camera.

Project goals:
- of course a 3d printable and usable large format field camera in 4x5" format. The design should be scalable to 5x7" or even 8x10" by just changing a handful of variables.
- Learning OpenSCAD. Learning to use it efficiently. Learning to do good parametric development/design.
- Learning git/github and sharing my code with other people

Some technical goals:
- the design is inspired by old and established field cameras like Horseman 45HD/FA or Linhof Technika. But it is also inspired by Intrepid and Standard Camera
- compact and lightweight. Projected weight with ground glass but without lens is about 1500g
- for 4x5": usable with lenses from 90-300mm. 
- up/down shift of about 30mm with a normal lens
- front/back tilt of about 20 degrees
- left/right tilt of about 10 degrees
- left/right shift optionally
- all movements on the front standard, no back movements
- easy switchable from landscape to portrait format
- tripod mount with Arca Swiss type mount
- all parts must be either 3D-printable or easily available.
- form follows function
- KISS
