Scalable large format field camera - 4x5 - 5x7 - 8x10

This is my attempt to create a scalable large format field camera.

Project goals:
- of course a 3d printable and usable large format field camera in 4x5" format. This should be scalable via a handful variables to 5x7" or even 8x10"
- Learning OpenSCAD. Learning to use it efficiently. Learning to do good parametric development/design.
- Learning git/github and sharing my code with other people
